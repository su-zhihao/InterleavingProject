    A student class contains learning information that worth consider for the
    question recommending model. We define sub-ability θ_ij ∈ [0, 1] to be a
    student’s ability on a question testing concept j that is preceded by a
    question testing concept i.

    We use 0 to represent a wrong answer, and 1 for the correct one
